## Problem
- Often, we need to write multiple sentences that have little to no variance. This takes unnecessary time. One might argue that we can just copy and paste the sentence. However, what if there's a specific rule that we applied to that sentence? This is where the tool comes in handy.

## Solution
- Using a sentence repeater with a variable editing feature. Where the users can define the variable position within the sentence, and how its own set of rules applies when duplicating the sentence.
